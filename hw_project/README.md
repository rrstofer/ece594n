# Projects

Goal: Put your skills in practice to tackle a project of your choice: perform geometric machine learning analysis on a biomedical dataset.

- Deadline for project reports and for presentations in class: Monday 03/13/2023 and Wednesday 03/15/2023.
- Teams of 1-4 students (5min per student during presentation).

**Examples**: You can find [here](https://github.com/geomstats/geomstats/tree/master/notebooks), within the "real world applications" notebooks, examples of potential projects.

# Register

Send the title of your project, and names of its team members, through slack to be registered.

# Guidelines

- Create a new folder in this folder with the name of your project.
- In this new folder:
  - Add python files.
  - Add the Jupyter notebook that represents your project's report.
  - Make sure to indicate which teammate did which part of the work.
- You can submit code to this repository anytime until the day of your presentation.

# Grading Criteria

- Project topic: is the question tackled by the project sounded, and is the dataset appropriate to tackle this question?
- Tools: does the project rely on tools taught by this class?
- Experiments: does the project run enough experiments to address the question at hand?
- Software: does the code run?
- Report: is the report (jupyter notebook) well-written and explanatory?
- Presentation: is the presentation clear?

# Remarks

Here are 2 examples of a great projects (from a different class, i.e. a different topic): [Shadow Removal](https://github.com/bioshape-lab/ece278a/tree/main/projects/Shadow-Removal) and [Single Image Dehazing](https://github.com/bioshape-lab/ece278a/tree/main/projects/Single_Image_dehazing).
